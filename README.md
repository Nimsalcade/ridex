Usecase:
Create a model that excels at writing optimal code solutions for various programming tasks. The model should use graduate-level reasoning to internally reflect on and improve its solutions, but present only the final, optimized code to the user. Explanations should be minimal unless explicitly requested. The model should cover a wide range of programming languages and concepts, focusing solely on coding-related activities.

Prompt:
Template:
Task: {{task_type}}
Language: {{language}}
Problem: {{problem}}
{{#if existing_code}}Existing code:
{{existing_code}}{{/if}}
Provide explanation: {{require_explanation}}

Schema:
{
  "\"problem\"": {
    "name": "\"problem\"",
    "description": "",
    "type": {
      "string": {}
    }
  },
  "\"language\"": {
    "name": "\"language\"",
    "description": "",
    "type": {
      "string": {}

  "\"existing_code\"": {
    "name": "\"existing_code\"",
    "description": "",
    "type": {
      "string": {}
    }
  }
}

Response:
Template:
{{solution}}
{{#if require_explanation}}
Explanation:
{{explanation}}
{{/if}}
{{#if complexity}}
Complexity: {{complexity}}
{{/if}}

Schema:
